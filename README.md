# Bike-Sales-

Using Microsoft Excel: I cleaned a dataset on Bike sales, produced pivot tables and created a dashboard. 
- Many insights can be drawn from this dashboard according to marital status, region, education level, commute to work distance, gender and income for those who have and have not purchased bikes.
